      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
#       The actions/checkout action is a built-in action provided by GitHub. The @v2 tag indicates that version 2 of the
#       action should be used. This action performs the task of cloning the repository's source code from the default branch
#       (usually main or master, here it's dev set up as default) into the Actions runner environment.

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
#       This specifies the action that will set up Docker Buildx which is a Docker CLI plugin that extends the
#       capabilities of Docker's build command. It's used for building Docker images in a more efficient and versatile way,
#       including support for multi-platform builds. The docker/setup-buildx-action is an action provided by
#       Docker, and the @v1 tag indicates the version of the action to be used. This action prepares the environment to use
#       Docker Buildx for building Docker images.
